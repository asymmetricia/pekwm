  very light window manager
  . 
  Pekwm is a window manager that once up on a time was based on the aewm++ window
  manager, but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all.
  It has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion,
  pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports keychains,
  and much more.
  .
  Some of its characteristics are:
   * Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be noticed.
   * Very configurable, everyone work and think in different ways.
   * Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things appear as they
     should when starting applications.
   * Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.
